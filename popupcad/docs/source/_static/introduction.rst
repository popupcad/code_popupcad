Introduction

popupCAD is software which enables a variety of geometric operations on laminate geometries, or ordered sets of geometry defined for each layer of material in a composite or laminate device.  This is facilitated by giving users access to the ability to draw or import two-dimensional geometry and manipulate it through the use of sketches.
